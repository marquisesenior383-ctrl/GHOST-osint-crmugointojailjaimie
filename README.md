## 🎮 Usage Guide

### Starting a New Investigation
1. **Create a case** in the Cases section
2. **Add people** with all relevant details
3. **Map connections** in Entity Network view
4. **Track locations** on the Global Map
5. **Import wireless networks** (if using WiGLE data)
6. **Assign tasks** to track investigation progress

### Wireless Network Intelligence
**Manual Entry:**
1. Go to Wireless Networks section
2. Click "Add Network" button
3. Enter network details (SSID required, rest optional)
4. Select associated people/businesses
5. Save and view on map

**KML Import:**

2. Go to Wireless Networks section
3. Click "Import KML"
4. Upload your KML file
5. Networks appear on map and table
6. Associate networks with people under investigation

**Map View:**
- Toggle wireless networks on/off in the global map
- Click WiFi icons for network details
- Filter networks by various criteria

### Entity Network Mapping

## 🔐 Security Considerations

**Critical - Production Deployment:**
- ⚠️ **Never use default passwords in production** - Application will refuse to start
- ⚠️ **Generate strong SESSION_SECRET** - Minimum 32 characters required
  ```bash
  # Generate a secure secret
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```
- ⚠️ **Set FRONTEND_URL** - Required for CORS security
- ⚠️ **Use strong DB_PASSWORD** - Weak passwords rejected in production
- 🔒 **Remove database port exposure** - Comment out port mapping in `docker-compose.yml` for production
- 🔒 **Never commit `.env` files** - Contains sensitive credentials
- 🔒 **Keep `backend/public/uploads/` out of version control** - User-generated content
- 🔒 **Review uploaded files for security** - Implement malware scanning if needed
- 🔒 **Follow local laws for data collection** - Comply with privacy regulations
- 🔒 **Use HTTPS in production** - Configure reverse proxy with SSL/TLS
- 🔒 **Regular security updates** - Keep dependencies updated

**Development vs Production:**
- Development mode shows warnings for weak credentials
- Production mode enforces security requirements and exits if not met

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

### Issue: "Table 'users' does not exist"
This has been fixed in v2.1.0. The users table is now created automatically.
```bash
# Rebuild containers to apply fix
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --build
```

### Issue: Application won't start in production
Check that you've set required environment variables:
```bash
# Verify .env file contains:
DB_PASSWORD=<strong-password-not-changeme>
SESSION_SECRET=<32+-character-secret>
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Issue: Permission denied errors in Docker
The backend now runs as non-root user (nodejs:1001). Ensure upload directories have correct permissions:
```bash
chmod -R 777 backend/public/uploads/
```

### General Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Check service health:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   # All services should show (healthy)
   ```

2. **View logs:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs backend
   docker-compose logs frontend
   docker-compose logs db
   ```

3. **Check health endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
   ```

4. **Verify database connection:**
   ```bash
   docker exec osint-crm-db psql -U postgres -d osint_crm_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
   ```

5. **Clean restart:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v  # WARNING: Deletes all data
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

6. **Check browser console** for frontend errors

7. **Open an issue on GitHub** with:
   - Error messages from logs
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Docker version
   - Operating system
